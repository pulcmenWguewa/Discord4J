- Aim for the head. Headshots deal more damage and can kill enemies faster. You can also get bonus points for headshots.
- Shoot the barrels and crates. They might contain items, such as health packs, extra ammo, or grenades. You can also use them to create explosions and damage nearby enemies.
- Use the reload button. You can reload your weapon manually by pressing the reload button on your controller or keyboard. This can save you time and prevent you from running out of ammo at critical moments.
- Switch weapons. You can switch between three different weapons: a handgun, a machine gun, and a shotgun. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. The handgun is accurate and fast, but has low power and capacity. The machine gun is powerful and has a large capacity, but is inaccurate and slow to reload. The shotgun is very powerful and can hit multiple enemies, but has a short range and a small capacity.
- Use the cover system. You can hide behind objects, such as walls, pillars, or cars, by pressing the cover button on your controller or keyboard. This can protect you from enemy fire and give you time to reload or heal. However, be careful, as some objects can be destroyed by bullets or explosions.
- Watch out for civilians. There are innocent people in some stages, such as hostages or bystanders. You should avoid shooting them, as they will reduce your score and health. You can also rescue them by shooting the enemies who are holding them or threatening them.
- Pay attention to the indicators. There are several indicators on the screen that can help you play better. The crosshair shows where you are aiming, and changes color depending on the target. Green means a friendly target, red means an enemy target, and yellow means an explosive target. The health bar shows your current health level, and flashes when you are low on health. The ammo counter shows how many bullets you have left in your current weapon, and flashes when you are low on ammo.

By following these tips and tricks, you can improve your skills and performance in Virtua Cop 3. You can also challenge yourself by playing on higher difficulty levels or trying to get higher scores.
