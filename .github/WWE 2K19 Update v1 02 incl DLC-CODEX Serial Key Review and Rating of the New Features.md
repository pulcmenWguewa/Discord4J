Here are some more paragraphs for your article:
 
## Target your opponent's limbs
 
Every single move in WWE 2K19 targets one or more limbs. A DDT will hurt your head, while an armbar predictably hurts arms. In addition to pulling off your normal moves, using the limb targeting system can help you weaken specific body parts of your opponent. This can make them more vulnerable to submissions and finishers that target those limbs. To use limb targeting, hold RB/R1 and press a face button to target a specific limb. You can also use the right stick to drag your opponent to different parts of the ring and inflict more damage on their limbs.
 
## Use Custom Match Tables in Universe mode
 
If you want to spice up your Universe mode matches, you can use Custom Match Tables to set the frequency of different match types. For example, you can make Hell in a Cell matches more common, or add more stipulations like Iron Man or Ladder matches. To access Custom Match Tables, go to Edit Shows in Universe mode and select a show. Then, go to Match Table and select Edit. You can add or remove match types, as well as adjust their probability of occurring.
 
## Read the objectives list in Showcase Mode
 
Showcase Mode is a mode that lets you relive the career of Daniel Bryan, one of the most popular WWE Superstars of all time. In each match, you have to complete certain objectives to progress the story and unlock new content. To see the objectives list, press pause and go to Objectives. Some objectives are mandatory, while others are optional. Completing optional objectives will reward you with bonus videos and items. Try to complete as many objectives as possible to get the full Showcase experience.
