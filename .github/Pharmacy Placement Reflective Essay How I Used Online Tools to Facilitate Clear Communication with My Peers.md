# How I improved my communication skills during my pharmacy placement
 
In this reflective essay, I will describe and analyse my experience of communicating with patients and staff during my pharmacy placement at a community pharmacy. I will use Gibbs' reflective cycle[^1^] to structure my essay and refer to the POWER IT Inq framework[^2^] to identify the skills I used and can improve.

During my four-week placement, I had the opportunity to observe and participate in various activities related to dispensing, counselling, medication review, health promotion and quality improvement. I interacted with different types of patients, such as elderly, children, pregnant women and people with chronic conditions. I also communicated with other staff members, such as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, pharmacy assistants and delivery drivers.
 
**Feelings**
 
I felt nervous and excited at the same time when I started my placement. I was eager to learn from the experienced pharmacists and apply my theoretical knowledge to practice. However, I was also anxious about making mistakes or saying something inappropriate to the patients or staff. I wanted to make a good impression and show my enthusiasm and professionalism.

**Evaluation**
 
Overall, I think I communicated effectively and respectfully with most of the patients and staff during my placement. I used open-ended questions, active listening, empathy and non-verbal cues to establish rapport and understand their needs and concerns. I also used clear and simple language, avoided jargon and checked for understanding when providing information or advice. I followed the pharmacy policies and procedures and sought feedback from the pharmacists whenever I was unsure or needed guidance.
 
However, there were also some areas where I could have communicated better. For example, I sometimes struggled to deal with angry or impatient customers who complained about the waiting time or the cost of their medicines. I felt frustrated and defensive when they blamed me or the pharmacy for things that were beyond our control. I also found it challenging to communicate with patients who had language barriers or hearing impairments. I relied on gestures or written notes, but I was not sure if they understood me correctly.
 
**Analysis**
 
According to the POWER IT Inq framework[^2^], communication is one of the key skills that pharmacy professionals need to develop and demonstrate. Communication involves not only verbal and written communication, but also non-verbal communication, such as eye contact, facial expressions, body language and tone of voice. Communication also requires adapting to different situations, audiences and purposes.
 
One of the models that can help me improve my communication skills is the Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument[^3^], which identifies five modes of handling conflict: competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding and accommodating. Depending on the situation and the person involved, different modes may be more or less appropriate and effective. For example, competing may be useful when there is an urgent or important issue that needs to be resolved quickly, but it may also damage the relationship or escalate the conflict. On the other hand, collaborating may be ideal when there is a high level of trust and cooperation between the parties, but it may also take more time and effort than other modes.
 
**Conclusion**
 
I learned a lot from my pharmacy placement experience about communication skills. I realised that communication is not only about conveying information or instructions, but also about building relationships and trust with patients and staff. I also recognised that communication is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather a dynamic and flexible process that requires constant adjustment and improvement.
 
**Action plan**
 
To enhance my communication skills further, I will do the following actions:
 
- I will read more literature on communication theories and models, such as the Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument[^3^], and reflect on how they can apply to my practice.
- I will seek more opportunities to practise communicating with different types of patients and staff in different scenarios, such as counselling, medication review or health promotion.
- I will ask for more feedback from my mentors, peers and customers on how I can improve my communication skills.
- I will attend workshops or courses on communication skills offered by the university or professional organisations.
